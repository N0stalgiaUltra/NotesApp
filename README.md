ðŸ“– This project was created to display my tech knowledge in native Android development with Kotlin. More techincal info below.

Notes App is a native Android App made with Kotlin. The app is capable of doing CRUD(Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations thanks to Room (SQLite Database); displaying the data (LiveData) in Note cards, inside a Recycler View; maintaining the model and view separation with MVVM and utilizing Clean Architecture and SOLID patterns to make the code clean, reusable and decoupled.

## Tech Stack

- Minimum SDK Level 25
- <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/">Kotlin</a>

- [Jetpack](https://developer.android.com/jetpack?hl=pt-br)
  - Live Data: Used for observe data from a reactive point of view. Allowing the data used in UI to be updated automatically.
  - Lifecycle: Observe the Android lifecycle and manipulate the states from the UI after the lifecycle change.
  - ViewModel: Used to retrieve the data from the Model layer and update the data from View.
  - ViewBinding: Manages the XML layout views in Kotlin through a class.
  - Recycler View: Show a more efficient way of displaying a list of Views in the screen, recycling the views for better performance.
  - Room: The persistency library that offers a abstraction layer on top of SQLite to allow for a more robust database access.
    
- Architecture
  - MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) + Clean Architecture: The first item is used to separate the logic of the app's UI, helping with testability and organization; also, the Clean Architecture helps to build the app's main system with well designed layers, who work with independency, facilitating with the scalability and maintenance.
  - Repository pattern: This pattern help with the data layerÂ´s abstraction

- Libraries  
  - [Koin](https://insert-koin.io/): Used for Dependency Injection
  - [Junit](https://junit.org/junit5/) + [Mockito](https://site.mockito.org/): Used to create and run unit tests
  - [Espresso](https://developer.android.com/training/testing/espresso?hl=pt-br): Used to create and run instrumented/UI tests

## Architecture
**NotesApp** was built using MVVM, Clean Architecture and the Repository pattern. Following [GoogleÂ´s official recomendation](https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture)
